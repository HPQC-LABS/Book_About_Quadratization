abstract = {Quantum annealers are physical devices that aim at solving NP-complete optimization problems by exploiting quantum mechanics. The basic principle of quantum annealing is to encode the optimization problem in Ising interactions between quantum bits (qubits). A fundamental challenge in building a fully programmable quantum annealer is the competing requirements of full controllable all-to-all connectivity and the quasi-locality of the interactions between physical qubits. We present a scalable architecture with full connectivity, which can be implemented with local interactions only. The input of the optimization problem is encoded in local fields acting on an extended set of physical qubits. The output isin the spirit of topological quantum memoriesredundantly encoded in the physical qubits, resulting in an intrinsic fault tolerance. Our model can be understood as a lattice gauge theory, where long-range interactions are mediated by gauge constraints. The architecture can be realized on various platforms with local controllability, including superconducting qubits, NV-centers, quantum dots, and atomic systems.},

@article{Rocchetto2016,
abstract = {In a recent paper, Lechner, Hauke, and Zoller (LHZ) described a means to translate a Hamiltonian of N spin-1/2 particles with all-to-all interactions into a larger physical lattice with only on-site energies and local parity constraints. LHZ used this mapping to propose a novel form of quantum annealing. We provide a stabilizer-based formulation within which we can describe both this prior approach and a wide variety of variants. Examples include a triangular array supporting all-to-all connectivity as well as arrangements requiring only 2N or N log N spins but providing interesting bespoke connectivities. Further examples show that arbitrarily high-order logical terms can be efficiently realized, even in a strictly two-dimensional layout. Our stabilizers can correspond to either even-parity constraints, as in the LHZ proposal, or odd-parity constraints. Considering the latter option applied to the original LHZ layout, we note that it may simplify the physical realization because the required ancillas are only spin-1/2 systems (that is, qubits rather than qutrits); moreover, the interactions are very simple. We make a preliminary assessment of the impact of these design choices by simulating small (few-qubit) systems; we find some indications that the new variant may maintain a larger minimum energy gap during the annealing process.},

abstract = {The idea of finding an all-encompassing model to describe the world around us has appealed to generations of scientists. Although we are very far from this ultimate goal, more modest steps can be taken if we focus on particular problems. De las Cuevas and Cubitt used concepts borrowed from computer science to show that all classical spin models (introduced initially to study magnetism) can be solved by tackling a slightly more complex, universal model (see the Perspective by Wehner). Thanks to these findings, it may be possible to physically simulate systems with complex interactions, using the well-understood two-dimensional Ising model with fields.Science, this issue p. 1180; see also p. 1156Spin models are used in many studies of complex systems because they exhibit rich macroscopic behavior despite their microscopic simplicity. Here, we prove that all the physics of every classical spin model is reproduced in the low-energy sector of certain {\{}$\backslash$textquotedblleft{\}}universal models,{\{}$\backslash$textquotedblright{\}} with at most polynomial overhead. This holds for classical models with discrete or continuous degrees of freedom. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for a spin model to be universal and show that one of the simplest and most widely studied spin models, the two-dimensional Ising model with fields, is universal. Our results may facilitate physical simulations of Hamiltonians with complex interactions.},

abstract = {? 2016 The Author(s).We demonstrate a direct mapping of max k-SAT problems (and weighted max k-SAT) to a Chimera graph, which is the non-planar hardware graph of the devices built by D-Wave Systems Inc. We further show that this mapping can be used to map a similar class of maximum satisfiability problems where the clauses are replaced by parity checks over potentially large numbers of bits. The latter is of specific interest for applications in decoding for communication. We discuss an example in which the decoding of a turbo code, which has been demonstrated to perform near the Shannon limit, can be mapped to a Chimera graph. The weighted max k-SAT problem is the most general class of satisfiability problems, so our result effectively demonstrates how any satisfiability problem may be directly mapped to a Chimera graph. Our methods faithfully reproduce the low energy spectrum of the target problems, so therefore may also be used for maximum entropy inference.},

abstract = {Quantum annealing provides a way of solving optimization problems by encoding them as Ising spin models which are implemented using physical qubits. The solution of the optimization problem then corresponds to the ground state of the system. Quantum tunneling is harnessed to enable the system to move to the ground state in a potentially high non-convex energy landscape. A major difficulty in encoding optimization problems in physical quantum annealing devices is the fact that many real world optimization problems require interactions of higher connectivity, as well as multi-body terms beyond the limitations of the physical hardware. In this work we address the question of how to implement multi-body interactions using hardware which natively only provides two-body interactions. The main result is an efficient circuit design of such multi-body terms using superconducting flux qubits in which effective N-body interactions are implemented using N ancilla qubits and only two inductive couplers. It is then shown how this circuit can be used as the unit cell of a scalable architecture by applying it to a recently proposed embedding technique for constructing an architecture of logical qubits with arbitrary connectivity using physical qubits which have nearest-neighbor four-body interactions. It is further shown that this design is robust to non-linear effects in the coupling loops, as well as mismatches in some of the circuit parameters.},

That quantum computation, which used only 4 qubits at 300K, actually also factored much larger numbers such as 3599, 11663, and 56153, without the awareness of the authors of that work. Furthermore, unlike the implementations of Shor's algorithm performed thus far, these 4-qubit factorizations do not need to use prior knowledge of the answer. However, because they only use 4 qubits, these factorizations can also be performed trivially on classical computers. We discover a class of numbers for which the power of quantum information actually comes into play. We then demonstrate a 3-qubit factorization of 175, which would be the first quantum factorization of a triprime.},

abstract = {The graph-theoretic Ramsey numbers are notoriously difficult to calculate. In fact, for the two-color Ramsey numbers R(m, n) with m, n ≥ 3, only nine are currently known. We present a quantum algorithm for the computation of the Ramsey numbers R(m, n). We show how the computation of R(m, n) can be mapped to a combinatorial optimization problem whose solution can be found using adiabatic quantum evolution. We numerically simulate this adiabatic quantum algorithm and show that it correctly determines the Ramsey numbers R(3, 3) and R(2, s) for 5 ≤ s ≤ 7. We then discuss the algorithm's experimental implementation, and close by showing that Ramsey number computation belongs to the quantum complexity class QMA. PACS numbers: 03.67.Ac,02.10.Ox,89.75.Hc In an arbitrary party of N people one might ask whether there is a group of m people who are all mu-tually acquainted, or a group of n people who are all mutual strangers. Using Ramsey theory [1, 2], it can be shown that a threshold value R(m, n) exists for the party size N so that when N ≥ R(m, n), all parties of N people will either contain m mutual acquaintances, or n mutual strangers. The threshold value R(m, n) is an example of a two-color Ramsey number. Other types of Ramsey numbers exist, though we will focus on two color Ramsey numbers in this paper. One can represent the N -person party problem by an N -vertex graph. Here each person is associated with a vertex, and an edge is drawn between a pair of vertices only when the corresponding people know each other. In the case where m people are mutual acquaintances, there will be an edge connecting any pair of the m correspond-ing vertices. Similarly, if n people are mutual strangers, there will be no edge between any of the n correspond-ing vertices. In the language of graph theory [3], the m vertices form an m-clique, and the n vertices form an n-independent set. The party problem is now a statement in graph theory: if N ≥ R(m, n), every graph with N ver-tices will contain either an m-clique, or an n-independent set. Ramsey numbers can also be introduced using color-ings of complete graphs, and R(m, n) corresponds to the case where only two colors are used. Ramsey theory has found applications in mathematics, information theory, and theoretical computer science [6]. An application of fundamental significance appears in the Paris-Harrington (PH) theorem of mathematical logic [4] which established that a particular statement in Ramsey theory related to graph colorings and natural numbers is true, though unprovable within the axioms of Peano arithmetic. Such statements are known to exist as a con-sequence of Godel's incompleteness theorem, though the PH theorem provided the first natural example. Deep connections have also been shown to exist between Ram-sey theory, topological dynamics, and ergodic theory [5].},

First, we discuss an efficient implementation of the " probing " technique intro-duced recently by Boros et al. [5]. It simplifies the MRF while preserving the global optimum. Our code is 400-700 faster on some graphs than the implementation of [5]. Sec-ond, we present a new technique which takes an arbitrary input labeling and tries to improve its energy. We give theo-retical characterizations of local minima of this procedure. We applied both techniques to many applications, in-cluding image segmentation, new view synthesis, super-resolution, diagram recognition, parameter learning, tex-ture restoration, and image deconvolution. For several ap-plications we see that we are able to find the global mini-mum very efficiently, and considerably outperform the orig-inal roof duality approach.

We demonstrate the capabilities of this Field of Experts model with two example applications, image denoising and image inpainting, which are implemented using a simple, approx-imate inference scheme.

abstract = {Adiabatic quantum computing has recently been used to factor 56153 [Dattani {\&} Bryans, arXiv:1411.6758] at room temperature, which is orders of magnitude larger than any number attempted yet using Shor's algorithm (circuit-based quantum computation). However, this number is still vastly smaller than RSA-768 which is the largest number factored thus far on a classical computer. We address a major issue arising in the scaling of adiabatic quantum factorization to much larger numbers. Namely, the existence of many 4-qubit, 3-qubit and 2-qubit interactions in the Hamiltonians. We showcase our method on various examples, one of which shows that we can remove 94{\%} of the 4-qubit interactions and 83{\%} of the 3-qubit interactions in the factorization of a 25-digit number with almost no effort, without adding any auxiliary qubits. Our method is not limited to quantum factoring. Its importance extends to the wider field of discrete optimization. Any CSP (constraint-satisfiability problem), psuedo-boolean optimization problem, or QUBO (quadratic unconstrained Boolean optimization) problem can in principle benefit from the "deduction-reduction" method which we introduce in this paper. We provide an open source code which takes in a Hamiltonian (or a discrete discrete function which needs to be optimized), and returns a Hamiltonian that has the same unique ground state(s), no new auxiliary variables, and as few multi-qubit (multi-variable) terms as possible with deduc-reduc.},

This was greatly celebrated as the largest experimental implementation of an adiabatic evolution algorithm to that date. However, in that computation, more than 66{\%} of the qubits used were auxiliary qubits, so the sizes of the Ramsey number Hamiltonians used were tremendously smaller than the full 128-qubit capacity of the device used. The reason these auxiliary qubits were needed was because the best quantum annealing devices at the time (and still now) cannot implement multi-qubit interactions beyond 2-qubit interactions, and they are also limited in their capacity for 2-qubit interactions. We present a method which allows the full qubit capacity of a quantum annealing device to be used, by reducing multi-qubit and 2-qubit interactions. With our method, the device used in the 2013 Ramsey number quantum computation could have determined R(16,2) and R(4,3) with under 10 minutes of runtime.},

The resources required to simulate a quantum circuit with L gates in this model are O(L) small-dimensional quantum systems (qubits or qutrits), a time-independent Hamiltonian composed of O(L) local, constant norm, projector terms, the possibility to prepare computational basis product states, a running time O(L log2 L), and the possibility to measure a few qubits in the computational basis.

abstract = {Quantum annealing provides a way of solving optimization problems by encoding them as Ising spin models which are implemented using physical qubits. The solution of the optimization problem then corresponds to the ground state of the system. Quantum tunnelling is harnessed to enable the system to move to the ground state in a potentially highly non-convex energy landscape. A major difficulty in encoding optimization problems in physical quantum annealing devices is the fact that many real world optimization problems require interactions of higher connectivity as well as multi-body terms beyond the limitations of the physical hardware. In this work we address the question of how to implement multi-body interactions using hardware which natively only provides two-body interactions. The main result is an efficient circuit design of such multi-body terms using superconducting flux qubits in which effective N-body interactions are implemented using N ancilla qubits and only two inductive couplers. It is then shown how this circuit can be used as the unit cell of a scalable architecture by applying it to a recently proposed embedding technique for constructing an architecture of logical qubits with arbitrary connectivity using physical qubits which have nearest-neighbor four-body interactions. It is further shown that this design is robust to non-linear effects in the coupling loops as well as mismatches in some of the circuit parameters.},

We present an implementation of a parity annealer with Transmon qubits with a specifically tailored Ising interaction from Josephson ring modulators.},

@article{Tanburn2015d,
abstract = {We introduce two methods for speeding up adiabatic quantum computations by increasing the energy between the ground and first excited states. Our methods are even more general. They can be used to shift a Hamiltonian's density of states away from the ground state, so that fewer states occupy the low-lying energies near the minimum, hence allowing for faster adiabatic passages to find the ground state with less risk of getting caught in an undesired low-lying excited state during the passage. Even more generally, our methods can be used to transform a discrete optimization problem into a new one whose unique minimum still encodes the desired answer, but with the objective function's values forming a different landscape. Aspects of the landscape such as the objective function's range, or the values of certain coefficients, or how many different inputs lead to a given output value, can be decreased *or* increased. One of the many examples for which these methods are useful is in finding the ground state of a Hamiltonian using NMR: If it is difficult to find a molecule such that the distances between the spins match the interactions in the Hamiltonian, the interactions in the Hamiltonian can be changed without at all changing the ground state. We apply our methods to an AQC algorithm for integer factorization, and the first method reduces the maximum runtime in our example by up to 754{\%}, and the second method reduces the maximum runtime of another example by up to 250{\%}. These two methods may also be combined.},
