\indent When optimizing discrete functions, it is often easier when the function is quadratic than if it is of higher degree. But notice that the cubic and quadratic functions:

\vspace{-4mm}

\begin{align}
b_1b_2+b_2b_3+b_3b_4 -4b_1b_2b_3 & \hspace{5mm} \textrm{(cubic)},\label{eq:intro_cubic}\\
b_1b_2 + b_2b_3 + b_3b_4 + 4b_1 -4b_1b_2 -4b_1b_3 & \hspace{5mm}\textrm{(quadratic)},\label{eq:intro_quadratic}
\end{align}

\vspace{1mm}


\noindent where each $b_i$ can either be 0 or 1, both never go below the value of -2, and all minima occur at $(b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4) = (1,1,1,0)$.  Therefore if we are interested in the ground state of a discrete function of degree $k$, we may optimize either function and get exactly the same result. { \textbf{Part \ref{partDiagonal}}} gives more than 40 different ways to do this, almost all of them published in the last 5 years.

%\vspace{15mm}

\vspace{0.5mm}
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
%\vspace{0.5mm}
\\
\vspace{-2mm}
\\
\indent The binary variables $b_i$ can be either of the eigenvalues of the matrix $b$ below, which is related to the Pauli $z$ matrix by $z=2b-\openone$. The Pauli matrices $x,y,z,\openone$ are listed below:
\vspace{0mm}
\begin{equation}
b\equiv\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix},\,z\equiv\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\
                0 & -1
                \end{pmatrix},\, x\equiv\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\
1 & 0\end{pmatrix},\,y\equiv\begin{pmatrix}0 & -\textrm{i}\\
                      \textrm{i} & 0
                     \end{pmatrix},\,\openone\equiv\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\
                                      0 & 1
                     \end{pmatrix}.  \label{eq:pauli}
\end{equation}

\noindent Any Hermitian $2\times 2$ matrix can be written as a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, so we can therefore describe the Hamiltonian of any number of spin-$\nicefrac{1}{2}$ particles by a function of Pauli matrices acting on each particle, for instance:

\vspace{-5mm}

\begin{align}
x_1y_2z_3y_4 + y_1x_2z_3y_4 + x_1x_2y_3 & \hspace{5mm} \textrm{(cubic)},\label{eq:intro_quantum_cubic}\\
x_1y_4 + x_2y_4 + x_3 & \hspace{5mm} \textrm{(quadratic)},\label{eq:intro_quantum_quadratic}
\end{align}
%where each spin $s_i$ can be any of the Pauli matrices, and

\noindent where the coefficients tell us about the strengths of couplings between these particles. The Schr\"{o}dinger equation tells us that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are the allowed energy levels and their eigenvectors (wavefunctions) are the corresponding physical states. More generally these do not have to be spins but can be any type of qubits, and we can encode the solution to \textit{any} problem in the ground state of a Hamiltonian, then solve the problem by finding the lowest energy state of the physical system (this is called adiabatic quantum computing). Eqs. \eqref{eq:intro_quantum_quadratic} and \eqref{eq:intro_quantum_cubic} have exactly the same energy spectra, so Eq. \eqref{eq:intro_quantum_quadratic} is one example of a type of quadratization, and many quadratizations in this book will also preserve wavefunctions.

Two-body physical interactions occur more naturally than many-body interactions so \textbf{Parts \ref{partTransverseIsing}-\ref{partGeneral}} give more than 30 different ways to quadratize general Hamiltonians (some of these methods may use $d\times d$ matrices instead of only the $2\times2$ matrices in Eq. \eqref{eq:pauli}, meaning that we can have types of qudits that are not qubits). All of these methods were published during the last 15 years.

%A quantum computer whose Hamiltonian is at least quadratic in $x$ and $z$ can find this ground state with only polynomial runtime overhead over the best alternative algorithm to find that solution.
 The optimization problems of Eqs. \eqref{eq:intro_cubic}-\eqref{eq:intro_quadratic} are specific cases of the type in Eqs. \eqref{eq:intro_quantum_cubic}-\eqref{eq:intro_quantum_quadratic}, but with only $b$ matrices.

%\section{Introduction}
%
%
%\textbf{\emph{Every}} computation can be done by minimizing a Hamiltonian
%of either one of the following forms:
%
%\begin{eqnarray}
%H = \sum_{i}^{n} \left( \alpha_{i}z_{i}+\beta_{i}x_{i} \right) + \sum_{ij}^{n} \left( \alpha_{ij} z_{i}z_{j}+\beta_{ij}x_{i}x_{j} \right), \label{eq:XX+Z} \\
%H = \sum_{i}^{n} \left( \alpha_{i}z_{i}+\beta_{i}x_{i} \right) + \sum_{ij}^{n} \left( \alpha_{ij} z_{i}z_{j}+\beta_{ij}x_{i}z_{j} \right), \label{eq:XZ+Z}
%\end{eqnarray}
%where the $z$ and $x$ variables denote the Pauli matrices:
%\begin{equation}
%z\equiv\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\
%0 & -1
%\end{pmatrix},\,x\equiv\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\
%1 & 0
%\end{pmatrix},
%\end{equation}
%the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ coefficients are real numbers; and the Appendix will teach any unfamiliar readers how to interpret this notation.
%
%We know that every computation can be done this way because the minimization can be done by adiabatic quantum computation (AQC), and it has been proven \cite{Aharonov2008,Biamonte2008} that AQC can simulate any circuit-based quantum computation with overhead that grows at most polynomially with the size of the problem, and we know that circuit-based quantum computation can simulate any classical computation with at most polynomial overhead. %% Incorrect citation:  %Mizel2007
%If we remove all the terms in Eq. \ref{eq:XX+Z} or Eq. \ref{eq:XZ+Z} that have $x$ operators, we get an Ising Hamiltonian that is quadratic:
%\begin{equation}
%H=\sum_{i}^{n}\alpha_{i}z_{i}+\sum_{ij}^{n}\alpha_{ij}z_{i}z_{j},\label{eq:ZZ+Z}
%\end{equation}
%and we no longer know of any proof that \textbf{\emph{any}} computation can be done by minimizing such a Hamiltonian with only polynomial overhead compared to circuit-based quantum computation or even classical computation, but plenty of very interesting problems can still be formulated as the minimization or approximate minimization of a quadratic Ising Hamiltonian, such as neural network training \cite{Altaisky2016}, computerized image denoising \cite{Ishikawa2009,Ishikawa2011,Ishikawa2014,Anthony2015}, integer factorization \cite{Dattani2014}, and Ramsey number determination \cite{Gaitan2012,Bian2013}, just to name a few.
%However unlike Eq. \ref{eq:XZ+Z}, plenty of devices that can minimize Ising Hamiltonians already exist, and with further restrictions on the $\alpha$ coefficients, D-Wave has made devices with $n=2000$, and this number has roughly doubled every 14 months since the first 1-qubit demonstration in 2003, a phenomenon analogous to Moore's law of classical computer growth, which has become known as Rose's Law.
%
%Furthermore,\textbf{\emph{ no classical computer has ever been able to minimize certain quadratic Ising Hamiltonians faster than the D-Wave machines to date}} \cite{Denchev2016,Mandra2016}, so being able to turn computations into the form of Eq. \ref{eq:ZZ+Z} appears to be promising in terms of demonstrating the first useful application of quantum supremacy (which is the term used for quantum devices outperforming classical computation devices).
%Moreover, for problems like neural networks and computerized image denoising, the best known classical computation algorithms also work by turning the problems into minimizations of Ising Hamiltonians, so even if you are happy with continuing to only use classical computer and have no interest in using quantum annealing devices, turning a problem into a quadratic Ising Hamiltonian minimization problem can be very powerful for some computations.
%
%For neural networks, image denoising, integer factorization, and Ramsey number determination, it is rather easy to turn the problem into the form:
%
%\begin{equation}
%H=\sum_{i}^{n}\alpha_{i}z_{i}+\sum_{ij}^{n}\alpha_{ij}z_{i}z_{j}+\sum_{ijk}^{n}\alpha_{ijk}z_{i}z_{j}z_{k}+\sum_{ijkl}^{n}\alpha_{ijkl}z_{i}z_{j}z_{k}z_{l}\ldots,\label{eq:Z+ZZ+ZZZ+ZZZZ...}
%\end{equation}
%but then \textbf{\emph{quadratizing}} Eq. \ref{eq:Z+ZZ+ZZZ+ZZZZ...} into the quadratic Ising form often requires the introduction of auxiliary variables, and since minimizing Eq. \ref{eq:Z+ZZ+ZZZ+ZZZZ...} often has cost $\mathcal{O}(2^{n})$, it is often extremely desirable to do the quadratization with \textbf{\emph{as few auxiliary variables as possible}}.
%Apart from quadratizing with minimum number of variables, it is also often desirable to reduce the number of non-zero $\alpha$ coefficients, to keep the non-zero $\alpha$ coefficients bounded or with specific values, to reduce the number of positive (non-submodular) $\alpha$ coefficients, to reduce the spectral ratio of the Hamiltonian (`maximum energy minus
%minimum energy' divided by `energy of the second minimum minus the energy of the global minimum'), and to reduce the number of energy levels close to the global minimum.
%Adjusting the energy landscape in order to accomplish all of these things apart from reducing the number of auxiliary variables needed has been termed Energy Landscape Manipulation (ELM) which is an entirely separate topic, sometimes even more important than quadratizing with as few auxiliary variables as possible, nonetheless this Review simply focuses on methods for the latter aim.
%
%It has been shown in \cite{Anthony2015} that a general function of the form Eq. \ref{eq:Z+ZZ+ZZZ+ZZZZ...} with degree $k$, can be quadratized using $O(n^{k/2})$ auxiliary variables.
%However, it is often possible to quadratize with far fewer auxiliary variables (for example when the auxiliary variables for quadratizing one term are reused to quadratize other terms that have some of the same variables in them) or to quadratize without any auxiliaries at all (ex. if a Groebner basis can be found with all basis functions being quadratic, or if some symmetries in the Hamiltonian can be found that make it possible to quadratize without auxiliaries).
%
%\begin{comment}
%Also shown in \cite{Ishikawa2011} that a PSB in $n$ variables requires at most $2^{n}-1$ auxiliary variables (by representing it as a function of degree $n$).
%
%Positive quadratic terms (non-submodular), particularly with large positive coefficients, are hard for a lot of reasons, classically (Ishikawa TGBMM....) \cite{Ishikawa2011}.

\section{Methods that introduce ZERO auxiliary variables}

\subsection{Deduction Reduction (Deduc-reduc; Tanburn, Okada, Dattani, 2015)} \label{subsec:deduc_reduc}


\vspace{-5mm}

\summarysec

We look for \emph{deductions} (e.g. $b_{1}b_{2}=0$) that must hold true at the global minimum.
These can be found by \emph{a priori} knowledge of the given problem, or by enumerating solutions of a small subset of the variables.
We can then substitute high-order terms using the low-order terms of the deduction, and add on a penalty term to preserve the ground states \cite{Tanburn2015c}.

\costsec
\begin{itemize}
\item $0$ auxiliary variables needed.%  Given a deduction, the reduction time is proportional to the number of terms in the Hamiltonian and is negligible. (but this is true of all the other reducs too)
\item For a particular value of $m$, we have $\binom{n}{m}$ different $m$-variable subsets of the $n$ variable problem, and $\binom{n}{m} 2^m$ evaluations of the objective function to find all possible $m$-variable deductions, whereas $2^n$ evaluations is enough to solve the entire problem. We therefore choose $m \lll n$.
%The computational cost of the search for deductions is difficult to estimate.
%The approximate worst-case complexity is $\mathcal{O}(n^{d+1}2^{m})$ where $m$ is the number of variables in a 'small' problem, $n$ is the total number of variables and $d$ is the maximum degree of deductions we are searching for.
%We suggest $10 \le m \le 20$, so that a small problem involves checking roughly $1,000$ to $1,000,000$ states, and $d=2$.
%See the appendix for more details.
\end{itemize}

\prossec
\begin{itemize}
\item No auxiliary variables needed.
%\item Able to use extra information about a given problem.
\end{itemize}

\conssec
\begin{itemize}
\item When deductions cannot be determined naturally (as in the Ramsey number determination problem, see Example \ref{subsec:Example_Ramsey_deduc_reduc}), deductions need to be found by `brute force', which scales exponentially with respect to $m$.
For highly connected systems (systems with a large number of non-zero coefficients), the value of $m$ required to find even one deduction can be prohibitively large.
%\item Deductions do not always exist, or are too hard to find.
\end{itemize}

\examplesec

\begin{comment}
Examples are difficult to illustrate in a paper, since they involve searching for patterns in exhaustive searches.
\end{comment}
Consider the objective function:
\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{equation}
H_{4{\rm -local}}=b_{1}b_{2}(4+b_{3}+b_{3}b_{4})+b_{1}(b_{3}-3)+b_{2}(1-2b_{3}-b_{4})+F(b_{3},b_{4},b_{5},\ldots,b_{N})
\end{equation}
where $F$ is any quadratic polynomial in $b_{i}$ for $i\ge 3$.
Since
\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{equation*}
\hspace{-4mm}H_{4{\rm -local}}\left(1, 1, b_3, b_4, ...\right) > H_{4{\rm -local}}\left(0, 0, b_3, b_4, ...\right), H_{4{\rm -local}}\left(0, 1, b_3, b_4, ...\right), H_{4{\rm -local}}\left(1, 0, b_3, b_4, ...\right),\notag
\end{equation*}
\uline{\textbf{\textit{it must be the case that $b_{1}b_{2}=0$}}}.
Specifically, for the 4 assignments of $(b_{3},b_{4})$, we see that $b_{1}b_{2}=0$ at every minimum of $H_{4{\rm -local}}-F$.

Using deduc-reduc we have:
\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{equation}
H_{2{\rm -local}}=6b_{1}b_{2}+b_{1}(b_{3}-3)+b_{2}(1-2b_{3}-b_{4})+F(b_{3},b_{4},b_{5},\ldots,b_{N}),
\end{equation}
which has the same global minima as $H_{4-\textrm{local}}$ but one fewer quartic and one fewer cubic term.
The coefficient of $b_1 b_2$ was chosen as $6$ because $6 \ge \max \left( 4+b_{3}+b_{3}b_{4} \right)$.

\end{itemize}

\newpage

\subsection{ELC Reduction (Ishikawa, 2014)}

\summarysec

An Excludable Local Configuration (ELC) is a partial assignment of variables that make it impossible to achieve the minimum.
We can therefore add a term that corresponds to the energy of this ELC without changing the solution to the minimization problem.
In practice we can eliminate all monomials with a variable in which a variable is set to 0, and reduce any variable set to 1.
Given a general objective function we can try to find ELCs by enumerating solutions of a small subset of variables in the problem \cite{Ishikawa2014}.

\costsec
\begin{itemize}
\item $0$ auxiliary variables needed.%  Given a deduction, the reduction time is proportional to the number of terms in the Hamiltonian and is negligible. (but this is true of all the other reducs too)
\item For a particular value of $m$, we have $\binom{n}{m}$ different $m$-variable subsets of the $n$ variable problem, and $\binom{n}{m} 2^m$ evaluations of the objective function to find all possible $m$-variable deductions, whereas $2^n$ evaluations is enough to solve the entire problem. We therefore choose $m \lll n$.
%\item To find every possible $m$-variable deduction for $n$ total variables would involve $3^n - 2^n -1$ evaluations of the objective function, whereas $2^n$ evaluations is enough to solve the entire problem. We therefore choose $m \lll n$.
%The computational cost of the search for deductions is difficult to estimate.
%The approximate worst-case complexity is $\mathcal{O}(n^{d+1}2^{m})$ where $m$ is the number of variables in a 'small' problem, $n$ is the total number of variables and $d$ is the maximum degree of deductions we are searching for.
%We suggest $10 \le m \le 20$, so that a small problem involves checking roughly $1,000$ to $1,000,000$ states, and $d=2$.
%See the appendix for more details.
%\item For $n$ qubits there is $\binom{n}{m}$ ways to choose $m$ of them and $2^m$ assignments of these $m$ variables, therefore $\mathcal{O}\left(2^{m}\binom{n}{m}\right)$ operations required to enumerate all possible cases for all possible subsets of size $m \le n$ variables.
\item Approximate methods exist which have been shown to be much faster and give good approximations to the global minimum \cite{Ishikawa2014}.
\end{itemize}

\prossec
\begin{itemize}
\item No auxiliary variables needed.
\end{itemize}

\conssec
\begin{itemize}
\item No known way to find ELCs except by `brute force', which scales exponentially with respect to $m$.
\item ELCs do not always exist.
\end{itemize}

\examplesec

Consider the objective function:
\begin{equation}
H_{{\rm 3-local}}=b_{1}b_{2}+b_{2}b_{3}+b_{3}b_{4}-4b_{1}b_{2}b_{3}. \label{eq:ELCexample}
\end{equation}
If $b_{1}b_{2}b_{3}=0$, no assignment of our variables will we be able to reach a lower energy than if $b_{1}b_{2}b_{3}=1$.
Hence this gives us \textit{twelve} ELCs, and one example is $(b_{1},b_{2},b_{3})=(1,0,0)$ which we can use to form the polynomial:
\begin{align}
H_{2\rm{-local}}&=H_{{\rm 3-local}}+4b_{1}(1-b_{2})(1-b_{3})\\
&=b_{1}b_{2}+b_{2}b_{3}+b_{3}b_{4}+4b_{1}-4b_{1}b_{2}-4b_{1}b_{3}. \label{eq:ELCreduced}
\end{align}
In both cases Eqs. \eqref{eq:ELCexample} and \eqref{eq:ELCreduced}, the only global minima occur when $b_1b_2b_3 = 1$.

A Groebner basis is a set of equations representing the zeros of a polynomial (e.g. of the form Eq. \ref{eq:Z+ZZ+ZZZ+ZZZZ...}) such that the number of variables is the same, and the zeros of Eq. \ref{eq:Z+ZZ+ZZZ+ZZZZ...} are the same as the zeros of all equations of the Groebner basis.
If a Groebner basis can be found such that all equations are quadratic, then quadratization of Eq. \ref{eq:Z+ZZ+ZZZ+ZZZZ...} is as simple as finding the Groebner basis.

\begin{comment}
Nike, this is NOT true.
Once we have the Groebner basis, we still need a single non-negative expression to minimize.
This involves finding appropriate coefficients of the equations to add together (non-trivial and what they do in the 1Qbit paper) OR squaring each one, which gives a quartic.
\end{comment}

\begin{comment}
Use the multivariate extension of Gaussian elimination to find a different set of equations which have the same vanishing set.
It has been shown these can be used to reduce and embed factorisations of all bi-primes up to 200,000 \cite{Dridi2016}.
Some work has been done in the field of ``boolean Groebner bases'', but these consider bases of a boolean ring over $\mathbb{F}_{2}$ rather than $\mathbb{Q}$.

%% Old description
\begin{comment}
\textcolor{red}{Richard: too much algebra here. People come from different
backgrounds. Some people don't know what rings are, and some people
get scared when they see fancy symbols like $\mathcal{V}$. It should
be possible to describe this to A-level students because that way
we know everyone (chemists, physicists, engineers, computer scientsists,
etc.) will understand it. I guess I already did this in a way that
A-level students would understand, in the ``summary section''. For
``descriptions'' I envision that we explain exactly how to DO the
methods, and for Groebner bases, I guess this would be equivalent
to listing the known algorithms (such as Buchberger's) and known codes
available. I guess another description that could be added is the
method in the 1Qbit paper, where they have a ``max\_cutoff'' and
a ``min\_cutoff'' and Groebnerized everything in between there,
or something like that.}

Instead of solving the equations $f_{1}=f_{2}=...=f_{n}=0$ directly,
Groebner bases consider the points on which they vanish, also known
as the \emph{algebraic variety} $\mathcal{V}(f_{1},...,f_{n})$. Groebner
bases are a 'pleasant' generating set for this variety.

This is done by first defining a monomial ordering on the polynomial
ring $F[b_{1},...,b_{n}]$, chosen so that higher order mononials
are considered 'bigger' than low order monomials. Monomials of the
same degree are sorted by the lexicographic ordering of the variables.
Then define the leading term of a polynomial $f$ with respect to
the monomial ordering to be $\mathrm{LT}(f)$, the largest monomial
of $f$. Then $g_{1},...,g_{m}$ is a Grobner basis if $\mathcal{V}(f_{1},...,f_{n})$=$\mathcal{V}(g_{1},...,g_{m})$
(they have the same vanishing set) and for every function $f$ in
the ideal of $\left\langle f_{1},...f_{n}\right\rangle $, we have
that the leading term of $f$ is divisible by the leading term of
$g_{i}$ for some $i$.

Grobner bases are very useful because they allow computation of remainders,
using the multivariate division algorithm. They are useful in this
context since the polynomials of the Grobner basis will have smaller
degrees than our original function, reducing the need for reduction
by other means.

Given a set of polynomials, a Groebner basis is another set of polynomials that have exactly the same zeros.
The advantage of a Groebner basis is it has nicer algebraic properties than the original equations, in particular they tend to have smaller degree polynomials.
The algorithms for calculating Groebner bases are generalizations of Euclid's algorithm for the polynomial greatest common divisor.

Work has been done in the field of 'Boolean Groebner bases', but while the variables are Boolean the coefficients of the functions are in $\mathbb{F}_{2}$ rather than $\mathbb{Q}$.

Consider the following pair of equations:

b_1 b_2 b_3 b_4 + b_1 b_3 + b_2 b_4 - b_3 = b_1 + b_1 b_2 + b_3 - 2 = 0.
\end{equation}

\noindent Feeding these to Mathematica's ${\tt GroebnerBasis}$ function, along with the binarizing $b_1(b_1-1)=\ldots=b_4(b_4-1)=0$ constraints, gives a Groebner basis:

\begin{equation}
\left\{ b_4 b_3 - b_4, b_2 + b_3 - 1, b_1 - 1 \right\}.
\end{equation}

From this we can immediately read off the solutions $b_1=1$, $b_2=1-b_3$ and reduce the problem to $b_3b_4-b_4=0$. Solving this gives a final solution set of: $(b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4) = (1, 0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1, 1), (1, 1, 0, 0)$, which should be the same as the original 4-local problem.

To quadratize the objective function:

H_{4{\rm -local}}=(z_{1}z_{2}-z_{3}z_{4}-1)^{2},

we first linearize the part that is being squared. In Mathematica,
the ${\tt GroebnerBasis}$ function gives us:

Then when we square it we get a quadratic function:

\begin{equation}
H_{2{\rm -local}}=1-2z_{1}-2z_{2}+3z_{3}+3z_{4}-2z_{3}z_{4}.

If the cubic term is zero, then the function becomes quadratic. We can use ELM (Energy Landscape Manipulation) to change the energy landscape \textit{without} changing the ground state \cite{Tanburn2015d}. In this case, we apply ELM in order to make the cubic term zero.

We therefore choose $m \lll n$.

In order to reduce the number of constraints required for the cubic term to be zero, we will assume that Deduc-Reduc told us that $(1-b_1)(1-b_2) + (1-b_2)(1-b_3) + (1-b_1)(1-b_3) = 0$ when the overall function is minimized, which means the ground state only occurs when at least two variables are 1. This does not allow us to assign the linear terms, but assigns all quadratic terms to have $b_ib_j=1$. This also suggests that $b_1b_2b_3$ can also be reduced to a linear term, but we do not know whether it is $b_1$, $b_2$, or $b_3$. So we have the following constraint on the cubic term, after setting all $f(b_1,b_2,b_3)$ to zero if there is not at least two 1's:

\begin{align}
f(1,1,1) - f(1,1,0) - f(1,0,1) - f(0,1,1) = 0.
\end{align}

\subsection{Split Reduction (Okada, Tanburn, Dattani, 2015)}

\summarysec

It is possible to reduce a lot of the problem by conditioning on the most connected variables.
We call each of these operations a \emph{split}.

\costsec

Usually slightly sub-exponential in the number of splits, as the number of problems to solve at most doubles with every split, but often does not double (since entire cases can get eliminated by some splits, as in the example below).

\prossec
\begin{itemize}
\item This method can be applied to any problem and can be very effective on problems with a few very connected variables.
\end{itemize}

\conssec
\begin{itemize}
\item Multiple runs of the optimization procedure need to be made, and the number of runs can often grow  almost exponentially with respect to the number of splits.
\end{itemize}

\examplesec

Consider the simple objective function
\begin{equation}
H=1+b_{1}b_{2}b_{5}+b_{1}b_{6}b_{7}b_{8}+b_{3}b_{4}b_{8}-b_{1}b_{3}b_{4}.
\end{equation}
In order to quadratize $H$, we first have to choose a variable over which to split.
In this case $b_{1}$ is the obvious choice since it is present in the most terms and contributes to the quartic term.

We then obtain two different problems:
\begin{eqnarray}
H_{0} & = & 1+b_{3}b_{4}b_{8}\\
H_{1} & = & 1+b_{2}b_{5}+b_{6}b_{7}b_{8}+b_{3}b_{4}b_{8}-b_{3}b_{4}.
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent At this point, we could split $H_{0}$ again and solve it entirely, or use a variable we saved in the previous split to quadratize our only problem.

To solve $H_{1}$, we can split again on $b_{8}$, resulting in two quadratic problems:
\begin{eqnarray}
H_{1,0} & = & 1+b_{2}b_{5}-b_{3}b_{4}\\
H_{1,1} & = & 1+b_{2}b_{5}+b_{6}b_{7}.
\end{eqnarray}
Now both of these problems are quadratic.
Hence we have reduced our original, hard problem into 3 easy problems, requiring only 2 extra (much easier) runs of our minimization algorithm, and without needing any auxiliary variables.

\vspace{5mm}

Note that the number of quadratic problems to solve is 3, which is smaller than 2$^2$ which would be the "exponential" cost if the number of problems were (hypothetically) to double with each split. This is a good example of the typical \textit{\textbf{sub}}-exponential scaling of split-reduc.

For $\alpha > 1$ we can quadratize a degree-$k$ negative term with one auxiliary variable $b_a$:

\begin{eqnarray}
-b_1b_2\cdots b_k \rightarrow b_a + \alpha\sum_i^k \left(1-b_i\right)\left(1-b_a\right) - 1.

\costsec
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 auxiliary variable to quadratize any degree-$k$ negative term.
%\item
%Each positive monomial of degree $i$ generates 2 auxiliary variables when it is reduced to the sum of a quadratic polynomial and a monomial of degree $i-1$, which can then be combined with existing monomials of degree $i-1$ if they are composed of the same variables. This combination of monomials can take place in each iteration, until the whole pseudo-Boolean function (PBF) becomes quadratic.
%\item Same as Ishikawa's method, use 1 auxiliary variable for each negative monomial.
%\item  For a $k$-local objective function, use a factor of $k$ less of auxiliary variables asymptotically compared to Ishikawa's method.
\end{itemize}

\prossec
\begin{itemize}
\item The coefficient $\alpha$ is adjustable, so there is flexibility in its size.
\item Many of the introduced quadratic terms are submodular.
\item It is a `perfect' quadratization, meaning that after minimizing over the auxiliary variable, the original function is exactly reproduced.
%\item Smaller number of auxiliary variables than the most naive methods. % needs to be fixed
%\item Fewer non-submodular linear terms than in the analogous quadratization for its complement (the parity function). % needs to be fixed
%\item Due to the recombinations of terms during its iterative reduction process, the resulting number of auxiliary variables is less than Ishikawa's method especially for PBFs with many positive monomials and many terms (the difficult case).
%\item The higher the degree of the PBF is, the more advantageous the CCG-based quadratization method is. It
%works particularly well for problems in real life such as planning problem that requires a high-degree PBF formulation.
%\item Due to the nature of recombinations
%of terms during each iteration, the number of quadratic terms in the finalized quadratic PBFs is less than Ishikawa's method.
\end{itemize}

%\conssec
%\begin{itemize}

This formula can be obtained directly from the PTR-KZ quadratization formula in terms of $b$, by starting with $8b_1b_2b_3$ on the left-side, making the substitution $b_i \rightarrow (1+z_i)/2$, and removing all terms that appear on both sides of the equation.

\subsection{Bit flipping (Ishikawa, 2011)}

\summarysec

For any variable $b$, we can consider the negation $\bar{b}=1-b$.
The process of exchanging $b$ for $\bar{b}$ is called \emph{flipping}.
Using bit-flipping, an arbitrary function in $n$ variables can be represented using at most $2^{(n-2)}(n-3)+1$ variables, though this is a gross overestimate.

Can be used in many different ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Flipping positive terms and using \ref{subsec:Negative-Monomial-Reduction}, recursively;
\item For $\alpha<0$, we can reduce $\alpha\bar{b}_{1}\bar{b}_{2}...\bar{b}_{k}$ very efficiently to submodular form using \ref{subsec:Negative-Monomial-Reduction}.
A generalized version exists for arbitrary combinations of flips in the monomial which makes reduction entirely submodular \cite{Ishikawa2011};
\item When we have quadratized we can minimize the number of non-submodular terms by flipping.
\item We can make use of both $b_{i}$ and $\bar{b}_{i}$ in the same objective function by adding on a sufficiently large penalty term: $\lambda(b_{i}+\bar{b}_{i}-1)^{2}=\lambda(1+2b_{i}\bar{b}_{i}-b_{i}-\bar{b}_{i})$.
This is similar to the ideas in reduction by substitution or deduc-reduc.
In this way, given a quadratic in $n$ variables we can make sure it only has at most $n$ nonsubmodular terms if we are willing to use the extra $n$ negation variables as well (so we have $2n$ variables in total).
\end{enumerate}

\costsec
\begin{itemize}
\item None, as replacing $b_{i}$ with it's negation $\bar{b}_{i}$ costs nothing except a trivial symbolic expansion.
\end{itemize}

\prossec
\begin{itemize}
\item Cheap and effective way of improving submodularity.
\item Can be used to combine terms in clever ways, making other methods more efficient.
\end{itemize}

\conssec
\begin{itemize}
\item Unless the form of the objective function is known, spotting these 'factorizations' using negations is difficult.
\item We need an auxiliary variable for each $b_i$ for which we also want to use $\bar{b_i}$ in the same objective function.
\end{itemize}


\examplesec

By bit-flipping $b_2$ and $b_4$, i.e. substituting $b_2 = 1 - \bar{b}_{2}$ and $b_4 = 1 - \bar{b}_{4}$, we see that:
\begin{eqnarray}
H & = & 3b_{1}b_{2}+b_{2}b_{3}+2b_{1}b_{4}-4b_{2}b_{4}\protect\\
 & = & -3b_{1}\bar{b}_{2}-\bar{b}_{2}b_{3}-2b_{1}\bar{b}_{4}-\bar{b}_{2}\bar{b}_{4}+5b_{1}+b_{3}+4\bar{b}_{2}+4\bar{b}_{4}-4.
\end{eqnarray}
The first expression is highly non-submodular while the second is entirely submodular.

\section{Methods that quadratize MULTIPLE terms with the SAME auxiliaries (Case 1: Symmetric Function Reductions, SFR)}

A symmetric function is one where if we switch any of the variable names (for example $b_1 \rightarrow b_5 \rightarrow b_8 \rightarrow b_1$), the function's output is unaffected.

Any $n$-variable symmetric function $f\left(b_1,b_2,\ldots b_n\right)\equiv f(b)$  can be quadratized with $n-2$ auxiliaries:

\begin{align}
f(b)&\rightarrow -\alpha_{0}-\alpha_{0}\sum_{i}b_{i}+a_{2}\sum_{ij}b_{i}b_{j}+2\sum_{i}\left(\alpha_{i}-c\right)b_{a_{i}}\left(2i-\frac{1}{2}-\sum_{j}b_{j}\right) \\
  c  &= \begin{cases}
{\rm min}\left(\alpha_{2j}\right) & ,i\in\text{even}\\
{\rm min}\left(\alpha_{2j-1}\right) & ,i\in\text{odd}
\end{cases} \\
a_2 &= \textrm{Determined from Page 12 of \cite{Anthony2015}}
\end{align}

\costsec
\begin{itemize}
\item $n-2$ auxiliaries for any $n$-variable symmetric function.
\item $n^2$ non-submodular quadratic terms (of the non-auxiliary variables).
\item $n-2$ non-submodular linear terms (of the auxiliary variables).
\end{itemize}

\prossec
\begin{itemize}
\item Quadratization is symmetric in all non-auxiliary variables (this is not always true, for example some of the methods in the  NTR section).
\item Reproduces the full spectrum.
\item When there's a large number of terms, there's fewer auxiliary variables than quadratizing each positive monomial separately.
%\item They say this is linear in the auxiliary variables, but it doesn't seem to be, because we have b_{a_{i}}b_{j} terms where b_{a_{i}} are auxiliaries.
\end{itemize}


\conssec
\begin{itemize}
\item Only works on a specific class of functions, although the quadratizations of arbitrary functions can be related to the quadratizations of symmetric functions on a larger number of variables. % this is found in the proof for the lower bound, in the ABCG paper. But it looks like n variables becomes 2^(n-1), see Lemma 5.1 or the lower bounds for symmetric vs arbitrary
\item All quadratic terms of the non-auxiliary variables are non-sub-modular.
\item All linear terms of the auxliaries are non-submodular.
\item Not meant so much to be practical, but rather an easy proof of an upper bound on the number of needed auxiliaries.
%\item Very complicated.
%\item Uses far more auxiliaries than other ... well here we're doign the whole function in one go....

\section{Methods that quadratize MULTIPLE terms with the SAME auxiliaries (Case 2: Arbitrary Functions)}
\subsection{Reduction by Substitution (Rosenberg 1975)}
\summarysec

Pick a variable pair $(b_{i},b_{j})$ and substitute $b_{i}b_{j}$ with a  new auxiliary variable $b_{a_{ij}}$.
Enforce equality in the ground states by adding some scalar multiple of the penalty $P=b_{i}b_{j}-2b_{i}b_{a_{ij}}-2b_{j}b_{a_{ij}}+3b_{a_{ij}}$ or similar. Since $P > 0$ if and only if $b_{a_{ij}}\ne b_ib_j$, the minimum of the new $(k-1)$-local function will satisfy $b_{a_ij}=b_{i}b_{j})$, which means that at the minimum, we have precisely the original function. Repeat $(k-2)$ times for each $k$-local term and the resulting function will be 2-local. For an arbitrary cubic term we have:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:rosenberg}
b_ib_j b_k \rightarrow b_ab_k + b_ib_j - 2b_ib_a - 2b_jb_a + 3b_a.
\end{equation}

\costsec

\item 1 auxiliary variable per reduction.
\item  At most $k\,t$  auxiliary variables for a $k$-local objective function of $t$ terms, but usually fewer.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Variable can be used across the entire objective function, reducing many terms at once.
\item Very easy to implement.
\item Reproduces not only the ground state, but the full spectrum.

\conssec

reading papers on QPBO (fascinating stuff, very impressive and in

%\section{Methods that reproduce the full spectrum}
%
%%All known methods to map the entire spectrum of a Hamiltonian rely on the same basic principle: auxilliary variables are added, to mediate the high-order interactions, and constraints are added to restrict the values which the axilliary variables can take. In practice, constraints are implemented as one and two term equations with much stronger energy penalties than those in the original Hamiltonian. As long as the constraints are sufficiently strong, the low energy subspace of the 2-local Hamiltonian will be exactly the spectrum of the original $k$-local Hamiltonian. Moreover, the location of the original `logical' variables is known and so the resulting configuration of the mapped variables can easily be determined.
%
%%If we want to reproduce the spectrum of  $b_1b_2b_3$, (such that the state $b_1=1,b_2=1,b_3=1$ will have energy $1$ and all others will have energy $0$)  we need to find a quadratic penalty function $P(a,b_1,b_2)$ such that if an auxilliary variable $a$ satisfies $a=b_1b_2$, $P(a,b_1,b_2)=0$, and $P(a,b_1,b_2)>0$ otherwise. If we can find such a function (we explain how to do this is subsection \ref{sub:recursive}), then the desired spectrum will be reproduced in the low energy sector of the following Hamiltonian.
%
%%\begin{equation}
%%H_{3-\rm{local}}=b_3\,a+\lambda\,P(a,b_1,b_2)
%%\end{equation}
%
%%\noindent where $\lambda$ is a large positive number.
%
\begin{comment}
These techniques will transform $k$-local functions to 2-local functions that not only have the same ground state as the $k$-local function, but also the entire input/output spectrum of the $k$-local functions will be preserved in the low-lying energy space of the corresponding 2-local function (which also has higher energy states due to the auxiliary variables added).

It follows from the universality of $3-\rm{SAT}$ that these `flag' clauses can be combined to map any spin Hamiltonian. To do this, we also need anti-ferromagnetic couplings to express the `negated' variable, to do this, we define,

%
% %Rather than considering a mapping which maps qubit values directly, let us consider a mapping which maps physical qubits to the relative parity of paris of logical qubits. If we consider only the relative parity pairs of qubits, we observe that there will be $n(n-1)$ such parity values, but not all of these parity values correspond to physically realizable configurations, for instance it is not mathematically possible for to have $z_1z_2=-1$, $z_2z_3=1$ and $z_1z_3=1$ simultaneously. We therefore need to add constraints to gaurantee that only mathematically consistant configurations are allowed. If we consider four qubits, these constraints are realized in the ground state manifold of the three qubit LHZ constraint Hamiltonian:
%
% Let us start with the LHZ constraint Hamiltonian, which constrains qubits describing 2-body parity terms to take only mathematically allowed values:
%
% \begin{equation}
% H_{\rm{LHZ}}=-z_{1,2}z_{1,3}z_{2,3}-z_{1,3}z_{1,4}z_{2,4}z_{2,3}-z_{2,3}z_{2,4}z_{3,4}. \label{eq:LHZ4}
% \end{equation}
%
% %Two local coupling between logical qubits in this state can therefore be achieved by introducing single qubit variables corresponding to each coupling, for instance adding a term $m\,z_{1,2}$ will intrduce a coupling between logical qubits $1$ and $2$ of strength $m$. If we want to add the four body constraint $z_1z_2z_3z_4$, we must add an additional physical qubit $z_{1,2,3,4}$ which is constrained to match the parity of $z_1z_2z_3z_4$. To accomplish this, we note that this total parity has to match $z_{1,2}z_{3,4}$, the Hamiltonian with added four body coupling of strength $m$ therefore takes the form:
%
% To add a four body term, we need to add a single qubit which couples to $z_{1,2}$ and $z_{3,4}$, single body constraints on this qubit correspond to a $4$ body constraint on the logical qubits.
%
%
%
% \begin{equation}
% H_{4-\rm{local}}=m\,z_{1,2,3,4}+\lambda\,(H_{LHZ}-z_{1,2}z_{3,4}z_{1,2,3,4}),
% \end{equation}
% where $\lambda$ is a large postive number.
%
% If we instead wanted to create the three body coupling $z_1z_2z_3$ of strength $m$, we would have to add an additional variable $z_1$, since Eq. \ref{eq:LHZ4} only constrains the logical qubits up to global spin inversion. By noting that  $z_1z_2z_3=z_{1}z_{2,3}$ we see that such a three body Hamiltonian can take the form:
%
% \begin{equation}
% H_{3-\rm{local}}=m\,z_{1,2,3}+\lambda\,(H_{LHZ}-z_{1}z_{2,3}z_{1,2,3}).

\begin{align}
H = \sum_i \left( \alpha_i^{(z)} z_i + \alpha_i^{(x)} x_i\right) + \sum_{ij}\left(\alpha_{ij}^{(zz)} z_iz_j  \right).

%
%\begin{comment}
%\section{Brute force numerical}
%
%If our only wish is for the 2-local Hamiltonian to preserve the ground state of the original $k$-local Hamiltonian, we can optimize the coefficients of the 2-local Hamiltonian so that the difference between the ground state of the original Hamiltonian and the ground state of the 2-local Hamiltonian is minimized under some desired measure. For example, if we wish for the dot product of the lowest energy eigenvector of the original $H$ and that of the new $H_{\rm{2-local}}$ to be 0.9, then the following two Hamiltonians are equivalent for our purposes:
%
%\footnotesize
%\begin{align}
%z_1z_2 +  y_1x_2z_3 \mapsto \alpha_1z_1 + \alpha_2z_2 + \alpha_3z_3 + \alpha_4z_4 + \alpha_5x_1 + \alpha_6x_2 + \alpha_7x_3 + \alpha_8x_4 + \alpha_9z_1z_1 + \alpha_{10}z_1z_2 + \cdots + \alpha_{72}z_4x_4
%\end{align}
%\normalsize
%
%{\color{red} This should be easy to optimize in MATLAB, assuming that 1 auxiliary qubit is enough. Most $\alpha$ are probably 0 because the characteristic polynomial of the left side is of degree 8, so there's far more unknowns than equations. We can then put numerical values above, in place of the $\alpha$'s}.
%
%% (relative to the difference between the lowest and highest eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian)
%
%Likewise, if we only wish for the lowest eigenvalue $E_0$ of the original $H$ to be recovered to within 0.01, for example, we can minimize the function $(E_{0,k-\rm{local}}-E_{0,\rm{2-local}})^2$ with respect to the ${\alpha}$ coefficients of the 2-local Hamiltonian until the objective function evaluates to a number smaller than 0.1$^2$. For example:
%
%\footnotesize
%\begin{align}
%z_1z_2 +  y_1x_2z_3 \mapsto \alpha_1z_1 + \alpha_2z_2 + \alpha_3z_3 + \alpha_4z_4 + \alpha_5x_1 + \alpha_6x_2 + \alpha_7x_3 + \alpha_8x_4 + \alpha_9z_1z_1 + \alpha_{10}z_1z_2 + \cdots + \alpha_{72}z_4x_4
%\end{align}
%\normalsize
%
%{\color{red} This should be even easier to optimize in MATLAB}.
%
%\noindent It is also possible to preserve more eigenvalues and/or eigenvectors than just the lowest, for example by minimizing the objective function:
%
%\begin{align}
%\sum_i^{i_{\rm{max}}}A(E_{i,k-\rm{local}}-E_{i,\rm{2-local}})^2 + B\frac{1}{\langle \psi_i| \psi_i\rangle}
%\end{align}
%
%\noindent where one can choose $A$ and $B$ according to whether preserving the eigenvalues ($A$) or the eigenvectrs ($B$) is more important.
%
%The more auxiliary qubits included in the 2-local Hamiltonian, the more parameters that can be optimized in attempt to make the ground state arbitrarily close to the orginal ground state.
%

%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Very general.
%\item Can control which aspects of the 2-local Hamiltonion are most important
%\item Can likely even gadgetize a "universal" Hamiltonian into an Ising one of larger sized Hilbert space
%\end{itemize}
%

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Doing the transformation costs more than solving the problem itself (only useful for testing what's theoretically possible).

%Non-locality from the original Hamiltonian, is transfered into a unitary transformation operator, which when applied to a $k$-local Hamiltonian, can reduce the $k$-locality of high order terms at the expense of increasing the $k$-locality of other terms which were chosen to be at most $(k-2)-$local.

\summarysec

Determine the $k$-local term, $H_{k-\rm{local}}$, whose degree we wish to reduce, and factor it into two commuting factors: $H_{k^\prime-\rm{local}}H_{(k-k^\prime)-\rm{local}}$, where $k^\prime$ can be as low as 0. Separate all terms that are at most $(k-1)$-local into ones that commmute with one of these factors (it does not matter which one, but without loss of generality we assume it to be the $(k-k^\prime)$-local one)  and ones that anti-commute with it:

\begin{align}
%H_{k-\rm{local}} + H_{(k-1)\rm{-local}}^{\rm{commuting}} + H_{(k-1)\rm{-local}}^{\rm{anti-commuting}}
 H_{ <k \rm{-local}}^{\rm{commuting}} +H_{ <k \rm{-local}}^{\rm{anti-commuting}}  + \alpha H_{k^\prime-\rm{local}}H_{(k-k^\prime)-\rm{local}}

\noindent Introduce one auxiliary qubit labeled by $a$ and the Hamiltonian:

\begin{align}
\alpha x_aH_{k^\prime-\rm{local}} +  H_{ <k \rm{-local}}^{\rm{commuting}} + z_aH_{ <k \rm{-local}}^{\rm{anti-commuting}}

The Feynman Hamiltonian can be written as \cite{Feynman1985a}:
\vspace{-5mm}

\begin{align}
\frac{1}{4}\left(x_{1}x_{2}-{\rm i}y_{1}x_{2}+{\rm i}x_{1}y_{2}+y_{1}y_{2}\right)U_{{\rm 2-local}}+\frac{1}{4}\left(x_{1}x_{2}+{\rm i}y_{1}x_{2}-{\rm i}x_{1}y_{2}+y_{1}y_{2}\right)U_{{\rm 2-local}}^{\dagger},
\end{align}

\noindent where $U_{{\rm 2-{\rm local}}}$ is an arbitrary 2-local unitary matrix that acts on qubits different from the ones labeled by "1" and "2". This Hamiltonian that is 4-local on qubits can be transformed into one that is 2-local in qubits and qutrits. Here we show the 2-local Hamiltonian for the case where $U_{{\rm 2-local}}={\rm CNOT}\equiv\frac{1}{2}\left(\openone+z_{3}+x_{4}-z_{3}x_{4}\right).$ We start with the specific 4-local Hamiltonian:

\vspace{-5mm}

\begin{align}
H_{{\rm 4-local}}=\frac{1}{4}\left(x_{1}x_{2}+y_{1}y_{2}+x_{1}x_{2}z_{3}+x_{1}x_{2}x_{4}+y_{1}y_{2}z_{3}+y_{1}y_{2}x_{4}-x_{1}x_{2}z_{3}x_{4}-y_{1}y_{2}z_{3}x_{4}\right),
\end{align}

\noindent and after adding 4 auxiliary qubits labeled by $a_{1}$ to $a_{4}$ and 6 auxiliary qutrits labeled by $a_{5}$ to $a_{10}$ and acted on by the Gell-Mann matrices $\lambda_{1}$ to $\lambda_{9}$, we get the following 2-local Hamiltonian:

\section{Perturbative $(3\rightarrow2)$ Gadgets}

The first gadgets for arbitrary Hamiltonians acting on some number of qubits, were designed to reproduce the spectrum of a 3-local Hamiltonian in the low-lying spectrum of a 2-local Hamiltonian.

\subsection{P$(3\rightarrow2)$-DC1  (Duan, Chen, 2011)} %The paper says "the terms in the product have to commute, but it's not clear if they mean each of the 3 terms of the product, or just the terms inside those terms, which would be much better.

% THERE IS A NEGATIVE SIGN DIFFERENCE FROM KKR, WHICH CAN'T BE ABSORVED INTO ANYTHING FOR THE SAME REASON WHY WE CAN'T ABSORB THE 6. IT'S BECAUSE THE 2-LOCAL HAMILTONIAN WILL HAVE TO ATTAIN THE NEGATIVE SIGN TOO, WHICH WE DON'T WANT BECAUSE WE JUST WANT TO WRITE THE 2-LOCAL TO 2-LOCAL TRANSFORMATION WITHOUT H_2LOCAL BEING PART OF THE FORUMA. NEGATING H_2LOCAL WOULD BE PART OF THE FORMULA OTHERWISE.

\summarysec

 For any group of 3-local terms that can be factored into a product of three 1-local factors, we can define three auxiliary qubits (regardless of the number of qubits we have in total) labeled by $a_{i}$  and  make the transformation:
%Group all $3$-local terms together and express their sum as a sum of products of commuting matrices $s_{ij}$:

%\begin{align}
%H_{3-\rm{local}} = \sum_i\prod_j^3 s_{ij} + H_{2-\rm{local}}. \label{eq:klocalInKempeMethod}

\prod_i^3 \sum_j \alpha_{ij}s_{i} \rightarrow \alpha + \alpha_i^{ss} \sum_i \left(\sum_j \alpha_{ij}s_{ij}\right)^2 + \alpha_i^{sx}\sum_i \sum_j \alpha_{ij} s_{ij}x_{a_i} + \alpha^{zz} \sum_{ij} z_{a_i}z_{a_j}

\section{Perturbative 1-by-1 Gadgets}

A 1B1 gadget allows $k$-local terms to be quadratized one step at a time, where at each step the term's order is reduced by at most one. In each step, a $k$-local term is reduced to $\left(k-1\right)$-local, contrary to SD (sub-division) gadgets which can reduce $k$-local terms to $\left(\nicefrac{k}{2}\right)$-local in one step.

\begin{align}
H_{k-\rm{local}} = \alpha \prod_j^k s_{j} .  \label{eq:klocalInKempeMethod}
\end{align}

\noindent

Define one auxiliary qubit labeled by $a$ and make the transformation:

\begin{align}
H_{k-{\rm local}} \rightarrow & \left(\Delta - \left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)^{\nicefrac{1}{3}}\Delta^{\nicefrac{2}{3}}s_{k}\right)\left(\frac{1-z_{a}}{2}\right) 
+ \frac{\alpha^{\nicefrac{1}{3}}\Delta^{\nicefrac{2}{3}}}{\sqrt{2}}\left(s_{k-1} - \prod_{j}^{k - 2}s_{j}\right)x_{a} \\
& +\frac{\alpha^{\nicefrac{2}{3}}\Delta^{\nicefrac{1}{3}}}{2}\left(s_{k-1} - \prod_{j}^{k-2}s_{j}\right)^{2} 
+ \frac{\alpha}{2}\left(\left(\prod_{j}^{k - 2}s_{j}\right)^{2} + s_{k - 1}^2\right)s_{k}
\end{align}

% !!!!!! Do we really need A and B to be non-overlapping, or is okay simply if they commute, which is a more general statement containing non-overlapping as a specific case?

Instead of recursively reducing $k$-local to $(k-1)$-local one reduction at a time, we can reduce $k$-local terms to $(k/2)$-local terms directly for even $k$, or to $(k+1)/2$-local terms directly for odd $k$. Since when $k$ is odd we can add an identity operator to the $k$-local term to make it even, we will assume in the following that $k$ is even, in order to avoid having to write floor and ceiling functions.

%\subsubsection{Perturbation theory}\label{sec:perturbation}
%In our notation the spin-1/2 Pauli operators will be represented as $\{X,Y,Z\}$ with subscript indicating which spin-1/2 particle (qubit) it acts on. For example $X_2$ is a Pauli operator $X=|0\rangle\langle{1}|+|1\rangle\langle{0}|$ acting on the qubit labelled as $2$.
%
%In the literature there are different formulations of the perturbation theory that are adopted when constructing and analyzing the gadgets. This adds to the challenge faced in comparing the physical resources required among the various proposed constructions.
%For example, Jordan and Farhi \cite{JF08} use a formulation due to Bloch, while Bravyi et al.\ use a formulation based on the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation \cite{BDLT08}. Here we employ the formulation used in \cite{KKR06,OT06}. For a review on various formulations of perturbation theory, refer to \cite{BDL11}.
%
%A gadget Hamiltonian $\tilde{H}=H+V$ consists of a penalty Hamiltonian $H$, which applies an energy gap onto an ancilla space, and a perturbation $V$. To explain in further detail how the low-lying sector of the gadget Hamiltonian $\tilde{H}$ approximates the entire spectrum of a certain target Hamiltonian $H_\text{targ}$ with  error $\epsilon$, we set up the following notations: let $\lambda_j$ and $|\psi_j\rangle$ be the $j^\text{th}$ eigenvalue and eigenvector of $H$ and similarly define $\tilde\lambda_j$ and $|\tilde\psi_j\rangle$  as those of $\tilde{H}$, assuming all the eigenvalues are labelled in a weakly increasing order ($\lambda_1\le\lambda_2\le\cdots$, same for $\tilde{\lambda}_j$). Using a cutoff value $\lambda_*$, let $\mathcal{L}_-=\text{span}\{|\psi_j\rangle|\forall j:\lambda_j\le\lambda_*\}$ be the low energy subspace and $\mathcal{L}_+=\text{span}\{|\psi_j\rangle|\forall j:\lambda_j>\lambda_*\}$ be the high energy subspace. Let ${\Pi_-}$ and ${\Pi_+}$ be the orthogonal projectors onto the subspaces $\mathcal{L}_-$ and $\mathcal{L}_+$ respectively. For an operator $O$ we define the partitions of $O$ into the subspaces as $O_-={\Pi_-}O{\Pi_-}$, $O_+={\Pi_+}O{\Pi_+}$, $O_{-+}={\Pi_-}O{\Pi_+}$ and $O_{+-}={\Pi_+}O{\Pi_-}$.
%
%With the definitions above, one can turn to perturbation theory to approximate $\tilde{H}_-$ using $H$ and $V$. We now consider the operator-valued resolvent $\tilde{G}(z)=(z\openone-\tilde H)^{-1}$. Similarly one would define $G(z)=(z\openone-H)^{-1}$. Note that $\tilde{G}^{-1}(z)-G^{-1}(z)=-V$ so that this allows an expansion in powers of $V$ as \begin{equation}\label{eq:G_expand}
%\tilde{G}=(G^{-1}-V)^{-1}=G(\openone-VG)^{-1}=G+GVG+GVGVG+GVGVGVG+\cdots.
%\end{equation}
%\noindent{}It is then standard to define the self-energy $\Sigma_-(z)=z\openone-({\tilde G}_-(z))^{-1}$. The self-energy is important because the spectrum of $\Sigma_-(z)$ gives an approximation to the spectrum of $\tilde{H}_-$ since by definition $\tilde{H}_-=z\openone-{\Pi_-}(\tilde{G}^{-1}(z)){\Pi_-}$ while $\Sigma_-(z)=z\openone-({\Pi_-}\tilde G(z){\Pi_-})^{-1}$. As is explained by Oliveira and Terhal \cite{OT06}, loosely speaking, if $\Sigma_-(z)$ is roughly constant in some range of $z$ (defined below in Theorem \ref{th:perturbation}) then $\Sigma_-(z)$ is playing the role of $\tilde{H}_-$. This was formalized in \cite{KKR06} and improved in \cite{OT06} where the following theorem is proven (as in \cite{OT06} we state the case where $H$ has zero as its lowest eigenvalue and a spectral gap of $\Delta$. We use operator norm $\|\cdot\|$ which is defined as $\|M\|\equiv\max_{|\psi\rangle\in\mathcal{M}}|\langle\psi|M|\psi\rangle|$ for an operator $M$ acting on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{M}$):
%
%\begin{theorem}[Gadget Theorem \cite{KKR06,OT06}]\label{th:perturbation}
% Let $\|V\|\le\Delta/2$ where $\Delta$ is the spectral gap of $H$ and let the low and high spectrum of $H$ be separated by a cutoff $\lambda_*=\Delta/2$. Now let there be an effective Hamiltonian $H_\text{eff}$ with a spectrum contained in $[a,b]$. If for some real constant $\epsilon>0$ and $\forall z\in[a-\epsilon,b+\epsilon]$ with $a<b<\Delta/2-\epsilon$, the self-energy $\Sigma_-(z)$ has the property that $\|\Sigma_-(z)-H_\text{eff}\|\le\epsilon$, then each eigenvalue $\tilde\lambda_j$ of $\tilde{H}_-$ differs to the $j^\text{th}$ eigenvalue of $H_\text{eff}$, $\lambda_j$, by at most $\epsilon$. In other words $|\tilde{\lambda}_j - \lambda_j|\le\epsilon$, $\forall j$.
%\end{theorem}
%
%To apply Theorem \ref{th:perturbation}, a series expansion for $\Sigma_-(z)$ is truncated at low order for which $H_\text{eff}$ is approximated. The 2-body terms in $H$ and $V$ by construction can give rise to higher order terms in $H_\text{eff}$. For this reason it is possible to engineer $H_\text{eff}$ from $\Sigma_-(z)$ to approximate $H_\text{targ}$ up to error $\epsilon$ in the range of $z$ considered in Theorem \ref{th:perturbation} by introducing auxiliary spins and a suitable selection of 2-body $H$ and $V$. Using the series expansion of $\tilde{G}$ in Eq.\ \ref{eq:G_expand}, the self-energy $\Sigma_-(z)=z\openone-\tilde{G}_-^{-1}(z)$ can be expanded as (for further details see \cite{KKR06})
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:selfenergy}
%\Sigma_-(z)=H_-+V_-+V_{-+}G_+(z)V_{+-}+V_{-+}G_+(z)V_+G_+(z)V_{+-}+\cdots.
%\end{equation}
%The terms of $2^\text{nd}$ order and higher in this expansion give rise to the effective many-body interactions.

\subsection{3-body Gadget from local X: Cao et al.~2013}
Cao et al.~2013 produced two new gadgets and also generally improved the known constructions for several typical gadgets.

\summarysec  ~In general, terms in perturbative gadgets involve mixed couplings (e.g. $X_i Z_j$). Although such couplings can be realized by certain gadget constructions \cite{BL07},
%\yudong{Here ``creation gadgets" is changed to ``certain gadget constructions".}
physical couplings of this type are difficult to realize in an experimental setting. However, there has been significant progress towards experimentally implementing Ising models with transverse fields of the type \cite{2006cond.mat..8253H}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dwave}
H_{ZZ}=\sum_i\delta_iX_i+\sum_ih_iZ_i+\sum_{i,j}J_{ij} Z_iZ_j.
\end{equation}
Accordingly, an interesting question is whether we can approximate 3-body terms such as $\alpha \cdot Z_i\otimes Z_j\otimes Z_k$ using a Hamiltonian of this form. This turns out to be possible by employing a perturbative calculation which considers terms up to $5^\text{th}$ order.

Similar to the 3- to 2-body reduction discussed previously, we introduce an ancilla $w$ and apply the Hamiltonian $H=\Delta|1\rangle\langle{1}|_w$. We apply the perturbation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:V5}
V = H_\text{else}+\mu(Z_i+Z_j+Z_k)\otimes|1\rangle\langle{1}|_w  + \mu\openone\otimes X_w+V_\textrm{comp}
\end{equation}
where $\mu = \left(\alpha \Delta^4 / 6\right)^{1/5}$ and $V_\textrm{comp}$ is
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ccl}
V_\textrm{comp} & = & \displaystyle \frac{\mu^2}{\Delta} |0\rangle\langle{0}|_w-\left(\frac{\mu^3}{\Delta^2}+ 7 \frac{\mu^5}{\Delta^4}\right)\left(Z_i+Z_j+Z_k \right)\otimes|0\rangle\langle{0}|_w+ \frac{\mu^4}{\Delta^3}\left(3 \openone +2 Z_i Z_j+2 Z_i Z_k +2 Z_j Z_k\right).
\end{array}
\end{equation}

To illustrate the basic idea of the $5^\text{th}$ order gadget, define subspaces $\mathcal{L}_-$ and $\mathcal{L}_+$ in the usual way and define $P_-$ and $P_+$ as projectors into these respective subspaces. Then the second term in Eq.\ \ref{eq:V5} with $\otimes|1\rangle\langle{1}|_w$ contributes a linear combination $\mu Z_i+\mu Z_j+ \mu Z_k$ to $V_+=P_+VP_+$. The third term in Eq.\ \ref{eq:V5} induces a transition between $\mathcal{L}_-$ and $\mathcal{L}_+$ yet since it operates trivially on qubits 1-3, it only contributes a constant $\mu$ to the projections $V_{-+}=P_-VP_+$ and $V_{+-}=P_+VP_-$. In the perturbative expansion, the $5^\text{th}$ order contains a term
\begin{equation}\label{eq:V55}
\frac{V_{-+}V_+V_+V_+V_{+-}}{(z-\Delta)^4}=\frac{\mu^5 (Z_i+Z_j+Z_k)^3}{(z-\Delta)^4}
\end{equation}
due to the combined the contribution of the second and third term in Eq.\ \ref{eq:V5}.
\noindent{}This yields a term proportional to $\alpha\cdot Z_i\otimes Z_j \otimes Z_k$ along with some 2-local error terms. These error terms, combined with the unwanted terms that arise at $1^\text{st}$ through $4^\text{th}$ order perturbation, are compensated by $V_\text{comp}$. Note that terms at 6$^\textrm{th}$ order and higher are $\Theta(\Delta^{-1/5})$. This means in order to satisfy the gadget theorem of Kempe \emph{et al.} (\cite[Theorem 3]{KKR06}, or Theorem I.1) $\Delta$ needs to be $\Theta(\epsilon^{-5})$. This is the first perturbative gadget that simulates a 3-body target Hamiltonian using the Hamiltonian Eq.\ \ref{eq:dwave}. By rotating the ancilla space, subdivision gadgets can also be implemented using this Hamiltonian: in the $X$ basis, $Z$ terms will induce a transition between the two energy levels of $X$. Therefore $Z_i Z_j$ coupling could be used for a perturbation of the form in Eq.\ \ref{eq:2body_V} in the rotated basis. In principle using {the transverse Ising model in Eq.\ \ref{eq:dwave},} one can reduce some {diagonal} $k$-body Hamiltonian to 3-body by iteratively applying the subdivision gadget and then to 2-body by using the 3-body reduction gadget.
$\quad$\\
$\quad$\\
\noindent{\bf Analysis.} Similar to the gadgets we have presented so far, we introduce an ancilla spin $w$. Applying an energy gap $\Delta$ on the ancilla spin gives the unperturbed Hamiltonian $H=\Delta|1\rangle\langle{1}|_w$. We then perturb the Hamiltonian $H$ using a perturbation $V$ described in \eqref{eq:V5}. Using the same definitions of subspaces $\mathcal{L}_+$ and $\mathcal{L}_-$ as the previous 3-body gadget, the projections of $V$ into these subspaces can be written as

\noindent{}The low-lying spectrum of $\tilde{H}$ is approximated by the self energy expansion $\Sigma_-(z)$ below with $z\in[-\max{z},\max{z}]$ where $\max{z}=\|H_\text{else}\|+|\alpha|+\epsilon$.
With the choice of $\mu$ above the expression of $V_+$ in Eq.\ \ref{eq:V_proj_fifth} can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Vp_simple}
V_+=\left(H_\text{else}+{\mu}(Z_1+Z_2+Z_3)+O(\Delta^{1/5})\right)\otimes|1\rangle\langle{1}|_w.
\end{equation}
\noindent{}Because we are looking for the $5^\text{th}$ order term in the perturbation expansion that gives a term proportional to $Z_1Z_2Z_3$, expand the self energy in Eq.\ \ref{eq:selfenergy} up to $5^\text{th}$ order:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:self_energy_fifth}
\begin{array}{ccl}

\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent{}Using this simplification as well as the expressions for $V_-$, $V_{-+}$ and $V_{+-}$ in Eq.\ \ref{eq:V_proj_fifth}, the self energy expansion Eq.\ \ref{eq:self_energy_fifth} up to $5^\text{th}$ order becomes

\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent{}Similar to what we have done in the previous sections, the norm of the error terms $E_1$ through $E_7$ can be bounded from above by letting $z\mapsto\max{z}$. Then we find that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:error_total_fifth}
\begin{array}{ccl}
\|\Sigma_-(z)-H_\text{targ}\otimes|0\rangle\langle{0}|_w\| & \le & \Theta(\Delta^{-1/5})
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent{}if we only consider the dominant dependence on $\Delta$ and regard $\|H_\text{else}\|$ as a given constant. To guarantee that $\|\Sigma_-(z)-H_\text{targ}\otimes|0\rangle\langle{0}|_w\|\le\epsilon$, we let the right hand side of Eq.\ \ref{eq:error_total_fifth} to be $\le\epsilon$, which translates to $\Delta=\Theta(\epsilon^{-5})$.

This $\Theta(\epsilon^{-5})$ scaling is numerically illustrated (Fig.\ \ref{fig:ZZZ_fifth_Delta_eps}a). Although in principle the $5^\text{th}$ order gadget can be implemented on a Hamiltonian of form Eq.\ \ref{eq:dwave}, for a small range of $\alpha$, the minimum $\Delta$ needed is already large (Fig.\ \ref{fig:ZZZ_fifth_Delta_eps}b), rendering it challenging to demonstrate the gadget experimentally with current resources. However, this is the only currently known gadget realizable with a transverse Ising model that is able to address the case where $H_\text{else}$ is not necessarily diagonal.

\begin{eqnarray}
H_{\textrm{ternary}} = -\lambda (z_1\,z_2+z_1-z_2)
\end{eqnarray}

In this implementation the variable $\frac{1}{2}(z_1+z_2)$ plays the role of $t$, assuming $\lambda$ is large and positive. For instance, when coupled to a binary variable $t\, z_3\rightarrow \frac{1}{2}(z_1+z_2)\,z_3$.

%\section{Notation}
%
%The left Kronecker product by a $2\times2$ identity matrix is implied by Eqs. \eqref{eq:XZ+Z} and \eqref{eq:XX+Z} in the following way for qubit operators $q\in\{z,x\}$, assuming $i<j$:
%Subasi \& Jarzynski (2016)
%
%\begin{align}
%q_{i} & =\mathbf{1}^{\otimes i-1}q\mathbf{1}^{\otimes(N-i+1)}\\
%q_{i}\bar{q}_{j} & =\mathbf{1}^{\otimes i-1}q\mathbf{1}^{\otimes(j-1+i)}\bar{q}\mathbf{1}^{\otimes(N-j+1)}.
%\end{align}
%Thinking in this way, with this notation might take some time to get
%used to, but tens of thousands of people are comfortable thinking
%this way (including any undergraduate student after a 1-semester quantum
%computing course). You can now see that $H$ is a $2^{N}\times2^{N}$
%matrix with elements that are complex numbers. ``Minimizing the Hamiltonian''
%just means finding the eigenvector of this matrix with lowest eigenvalue.
%On a classical computer, the cost of finding this eigenvector is the
%cost of diagonalizing the matrix: $\mathcal{O}(2^{3N})$, but undergraduate
%level quantum mechanics tells us that any physical system's state
%(wavefunction, $\psi_{n}$) is an eigenvector of a Hamiltonian and
%the eigenvalue $E_{n}$ is just the energy associated with being in
%the $n^{{\rm th}}$ energy level:
%\begin{equation}
%H\psi_{n}=E_{n}\psi_{n}.\label{eq:TISE}
%\end{equation}
%Eq. \ref{eq:TISE} is just the time-independent version of the Schroedinger
%equation, which you have at least heard of. The diagonal elements
%are the energies of the $n$ levels and the off-diagonals are associated
%with the propensity for tunnelling from level $n$ to level $m$.
%Any $2^{N}$ level system can be represented by $N$ spin-$\nicefrac{1}{2}$
%particles (\textbf{\uline{qubtis}}), and an example of a spin-$\nicefrac{1}{2}$
%particle is simply an electron. Some of the $N$ electrons will have
%spin up and some will have spin down, hence $2^{N}$ possibilities.
%So instead of $\mathcal{O}(2^{3N})$ operations on a classical computer
%for finding the eigenvector with lowest eigenvalue (and hence doing
%the completely arbitrary computation), we can just (for example) put
%$N$ electrons together %
%\begin{comment}
%such that the $2^{N}$ energy levels have energies $H_{ii}$ and tunelling
%amplitudes $H_{ij}$
%\end{comment}
%with the appropriate $H$ describing their energy, and then cool the
%system down to its ground state. This ground state is one out of $2^{N}$
%possible states , and the configuration of spin up and spin down electrons
%encodes the desired computation.

\section{Further Examples}

\examplesec \label{subsec:Example_Ramsey_deduc_reduc}
Here we show how deductions can arise naturally from the Ramsey number problem.
Consider $\mathbb{\mathcal{R}}(4,3)$ with $N=4$ nodes.
Consider a Hamiltonian:
\begin{equation}
H = (1-z_{12})(1-z_{13})(1-z_{23})+\ldots+(1-z_{23})(1-z_{24})(1-z_{34})+ z_{12}z_{13}z_{14}z_{23}z_{24}z_{34}.
\end{equation}

\begin{comment}
We should assume there are no 3-independent sets, so we have deductions:
$(1-z_{ij})(1-z_{ik})(1-z_{jk})=0$, for each $i,j,k$.
\end{comment}
See \cite{Okada2015} for full details of how we arrive at this Hamiltonian.

Since we are assuming we have no 3-independent sets, we know that
$(1-z_{12})(1-z_{13})(1-z_{23})=0$, so $z_{12}z_{13}z_{23}=z_{12}z_{13}+z_{12}z_{23}+z_{13}z_{23}-z_{12}-z_{13}-z_{23}+1$.
This will be our deduction.

Using deduc-reduc we can substitute this into our 6-local term to get:
\begin{eqnarray}
H & = & 2(1-z_{12})(1-z_{13})(1-z_{23})+\ldots+(1-z_{23})(1-z_{24})(1-z_{34})+\\
 &  & z_{14}z_{24}z_{34}(z_{12}z_{13}+z_{12}z_{23}+z_{13}z_{23}-z_{12}-z_{13}-z_{23}+1).
\end{eqnarray}

We could repeat this process to remove all 5- and 4-local terms without adding any auxiliary qubits.
Note in this case the error terms added by deduc-reduc already appear in our Hamiltonian.

%\begin{align}
%\sum_i\prod_j^3 s_{ij} + H_{2-\rm{local}} \rightarrow \frac{1}{24\Delta} \left( \sum_i \left( \sum_j z_{a_{ij}} \right)^2 - \sum_j 1\right) - \frac{1}{6\Delta^{\nicefrac{2}{3}}}\left( \sum_{ij} x_{a_{ij}} \right) - \frac{1}{6\Delta^{\nicefrac{1}{3}}}\left( s_{ij}^2  \right) -\frac{1}{6} H_{\textrm{2-local}}
%\end{align}
%%\sum_i\prod_{j}^k s_{ij} \mapsto \frac{\Delta}{4}\left( 9 - \sum_i \left( \sum_j  z_{a_{ij}} \right)^2 - \sum_j z_{a_{ij}}^2 + \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{6\Delta}} x_{a_{ij}}  \right).

\section{$2\rightarrow 2$ gadgets}
This review has only focused on $k-$local to $2-$local transformations where $k>2$. There is also a large number of $2-$local to $2-$local transformations in the literature, which are used for various pruposes. Some of these are listed here:

\vspace{10mm}

\begin{itemize}
\item Gadgetization of any $2-$local Hamiltonian into $\{\openone,z,x,zz,xx\}$ or $\{\openone,z,x,zx\}$ \cite{Biamonte2008}. Used for the proof that $xx + zz$ or $xz$ is universal is enough for universal quantum computation. In other words, \textit{any} computation can be transformed into a problem of finding the ground state of a $2-$local Hamiltonian containing terms from $\{\openone,z,x,zz,xx\}$ or from $\{\openone,z,x,zx\}$ with real coefficients, and the ground state can be found by adiabatic quantum computing with only polynomial time and space overhead over the best alternative algorithm for the problem.

\item Transformation of any $2-$local Hamiltonian into $\{\openone,z,x,zz,xx+yy\}$, without any perturbative gadgets, and only requiring the qubits to be connected in an almost 2D lattice \cite{Lloyd2016}.


\item "Cross gadget", "fork gadget", and "triangle gadget" described in \cite{Oliveira2008}.
\item Gadgetizeation of a $2-$local Hamiltonian with very strong couplings, into a $2-$local Hamiltonian with strengths in $\mathcal{O}\left( \nicefrac{1}{\textrm{poly}\left( \epsilon^{-1},n\right)}  \right)$, and $\textrm{poly}\left( \epsilon^{-1},n  \right)$ auxiliary qubits and $\textrm{poly}\left( \epsilon^{-1},n  \right)$ new quadratic terms. \cite{Cao2015a}.
\item $yy$ creation gadget: Simulation of $yy$ terms  using $\{\openone,z,x,zz,xx\}$, with coupling strength restriction defined according to $\Delta = \Theta\left(\epsilon^{-4}\right)$ \cite{Cao2015}. % they do not even say they need \openone, but maybe they are ignoring it due to causing a constant shift.

\begin{itemize} % check when Toby helped us with the bit-flipping stuff
\item It is with immense pleasure that we thank Emile Okada of Cambridge University, who during his first year of udnergraduate study, worked with Nike Dattani and Richard Tanburn on quadratization of pseudo-boolean functions for quantum annealing, and in the first half of 2015 played a role in the development of the Deduc-Reduc and Split-Reduc and Groebner bases methods presented in this review.
\item We thank Gernot Schaller of University of Berlin, who in December 2014 provided Nike Dattani with insights into his quadratization methods mentioned in this review paper, as well as for sharnig his Mathematica code which could be used to generate such quadratization formulas and others.
\item We thank Mohammad Amin of D-Wave for pointing Nike Dattani to the paper \cite{Bian2013} on determining Ramsey numbers on the D-Wave device, which contained what we call in this review "Reduction by substitution", later found through Ishikawa's paper to be from the much older 1970s paper by Rozenberg.
\item We thank Catherine McGeoch of Amherst University and D-Wave, for helpful discussions with Nike Dattani in December 2014 about how to map quadratic pseudo-Boolean optimization problems onto the chimera graph of the D-Wave hardware and for pointing us to the important references of Vicky Choi. While chimerization is very different from quadratization, understanding that roughly $n^2$ variables would be needed to map a quadratic function of $n$ variables, helped Nike Dattani and Richard Tanburn to appreciate how impotrant it is to be able to quadratize with as few variables as possible, and having this in mind throughout our studies helped inspire us in our goals towards "optimal quadratization".
\item We thank Aritanan Gruber and Endre Boros of Rutgers University, who in August 2015 shared with Nike Dattani and Richard Tanburn some of their wisdom about sub-modularity, and Aritanan Gruber for pointing us to the then very recent paper of Hiroshi Ishikawa on what we call in this review "ELC reductions", which was also a valuable paper due to the references in it. We also thank him for helping us in our quest to determine whether or not "deduc-reduc" was a re-discovery by Richard, Emile, and Nike, or perhaps a novel quadratization scheme.
\item We thank Toby Cathcart-Burn of Oxford University, who during the third year of undergraduate study, worked with Nike Dattani and Richard Tanburn and in Autumn 2015 and Winter 2016 helped us gain insights about the application of deduc-reduc and bit flipping to the problem of determining Ramsey numbers via discrete optimization, and for insights into the trade-offs between Ishikawa's symmetric reduction and reduction by substitution.
\item  We thank Hiroshi Ishikawa of Waseda University, who Nike Dattani had the memorable opportunity to visit in November 2015, and through discussions about the computer vision problem and neural network problem (two examples of real-world discrete optimization problems that benefit from quadratization), provided insights about the role of quadratization for calculations on classical computers. In particular, solving the computer vision problem in which he had experience solving on classical computers, was very different from the integer factoring problem and Ramsey number problem which we had been attempting to quadratize for D-Wave and NMR devices. He taught us that far more total (original plus auxiliary) variables can be tolerated on classical computers than on D-Wave machines or NMR systems, and approximate solutions to the optimization problems are acceptable (unlike for the factorization and Ramsey number problems in which we were interested). This gave us more insight into what trade-offs one might wish to prioritize when quadratizing optially. We also thank him for helping us in our quest to determine whether or not "deduc-reduc" was a re-discovery by Richard, Emile, and Nike, or perhaps a novel quadratization scheme.
\item We thank Salil Bedkihal for informing Nike of the paper by Hirsch which uses the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, now mentioned in the "Further References" section.
\item Last but indubitably not least, we thank Jacob Biamonte of Skolkovo Institute of Technology, who Nike Dattani enjoyed visiting in Hangzhou in January 2017 and meeting at Harvard University in April 2018. Jacob provided us plenty of insights about perturbative gadgets, made valuable comments on early versions of our manuscript, and has been a major supporter of this review paper since the idea was presented to him in December 2016. At many points during the preparation of this review, we had prioritized other commitments and put preparation of this review aside. Jake's frequent encouragement was often what got us working on this review again. Without him, we are not certain this paper would have been completed by this time (or ever!).

%Dear Toby,
%
%I can see some easy ways of doing better than M-3 or M-4 extra qubits. Simply pairing variables halves the number of extra qubits required if you use Ishikawa's method, while giving a few quartics;
%
%If by "simply pairing" you mean x1x2x3x4 -> y1y2, where y1=x1x2 and y2=x3x4, I can see how it halves the number of extra qubits, and how it introduces the quartic term a*y1y2. I can also see that the cubic term introduced has negative coefficient, so can be quadratized with only 1 qubit.
%
%...
%
%and similar pairing can be used to modify the penalty function given in the appendix to replace a cubic(quartic) with a single variable using only cubic(quartic) terms.
