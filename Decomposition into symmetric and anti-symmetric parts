% Idea: Decompose a quadratic equation into symmetric and skew-symmetric parts. 
% For example, A is matrix. 
% Symmetric: A = Transpose(A).
% Skew-symmetric: - A = Transpose(A)

%Setting up the coefficients using Eric Huang's setup
b = dec2bin(2^4-1:-1:0)-'0';
b1 = b(:,1)
b2 = b(:,2)
b3 = b(:,3)
b4 = b(:,4)

% Take quadratic function as an example (Eq. 2 from the book)
% f = f_sym + f_anti
f = b1.*b2 + b2.*b3 + b3.*b4 - 4*b1.*b2.*b3;

% f_sym = (1/2)*(f(b) + transpose f(b))
f_sym = (1/2)*(f + f.')

% f_anti = (1/2)*(f(b) - transpose f(b))
f_anti = (1/2)*(f - f.')
